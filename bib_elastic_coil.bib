	abstract = {A discrete model of the elastic rod is investigated. The model consists of two rigid rods connected with each other by spiral springs. The rods are supposed to be loaded by the constant force couple and by the constant tracking force such that the tracking force makes a constant angle with the normal to the free end cross-section of one of the rods. Equilibriums are obtained and their "abnormal" properties are considered. The equilibrium stability as a first approximation is investigated.},

	abstract = {We present a discrete treatment of adapted framed curves, parallel transport, and holonomy, thus establishing the language for a discrete geometric model of thin ﬂexible rods with arbitrary cross section and undeformed conﬁguration. Our approach differs from existing simulation techniques in the graphics and mechanics literature both in the kinematic description—we represent the material frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame—as well as in the dynamical treatment—we treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigidbodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efﬁcient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the coupling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

	abstract = {A helix (), plural helixes or helices (), is a shape like a corkscrew or spiral staircase.  It is a type of smooth space curve with tangent lines at a constant angle to a fixed axis. Helices are important in biology, as the {DNA} molecule is formed as two intertwined helices, and many proteins have helical substructures, known as alpha helices. The word helix comes from the Greek word ἕλιξ, "twisted, curved". A "filled-in" helix – for example, a "spiral" (helical) ramp – is called a helicoid.},
